1.  Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pangram or not.
Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" 

2.  Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.

3. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns product of all elements in the list.

4.  Write a Python function student_data () which will print the id of a student (student_id). If the user passes an argument student_name or student_class the function will print the student name and class.

5. Write a Python class to find a pair of elements (indices of the two numbers) from a given array whose sum equals a specific target number.
Input: numbers= [10,20,10,40,50,60,70], target=50
Output: 3, 4

6. Write a Python class to reverse a string word by word. 

7. Create a BankAccount class. Your class should support the following methods:
- withdraw
- deposit
- get_balance
- change_pin

Create a SavingsAccount class that behaves just like a BankAccount, but also has an interest rate and a method that increases the balance by the appropriate amount of interest.
Once you’ve created a new class, it can be used just like any other class. For instance, you can create a subclass of a class that is a subclass of another class and so on. Create a FeeSavingsAccount class that behaves just like a SavingsAccount, but also charges a fee every time you withdraw money. The fee should be set in the constructor and deducted before each withdrawal.
